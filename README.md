# 🎉 GRASS is Ready! 🎉

We’ve released two versions of software for farming Grass:


- 🔥 FREE version works only with accounts registered through it. (Free version link in the post)
- 💎 PAID version supports any accounts — register using your own referral code! (DM us for the paid version: Telegram: https://t.me/CRYPT0HER)

🚀 What can our software do?

- ✅ Account registration
- ✅ Email verification
- ✅ Wallet approval
- ✅ Farming in X1, X1.25, and X2 modes


💪 Why is GRASS better than alternatives?
- 1️⃣ Traffic efficiency — consumes much less data compared to competitors.
- 2️⃣ Speed — works significantly faster than other solutions.
- 3️⃣ Smart proxy manager — instantly switches proxies if a connection drops.
- 4️⃣ Optimized performance — no need for 3–5–10 servers. You only need 1–2 servers for full functionality. For Windows, the optimal thread count is 15K, with some servers capable of handling even more!

🛠 What else can we offer?
- Unlimited residential proxies (price negotiable, depends on server count).
- Traffic-based proxies — just $1.5 per GB (coming soon).
- Upcoming software will support projects like Pipe Network, Bless, Gradient, Nodepay, and Down.
